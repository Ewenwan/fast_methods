# Overview

This pages provide basic documentation about the Fast Marching code packages I have created.

- [Software design](markdown/design.md)
- [Detailed building](markdown/building.md)
- [Benchmarking](markdown/benchmarking.md)
- [nDGridMap implementation](files/nDGridMap.pdf): Probably, the most complex part of the code. It encapsulates the complexity of the n-dimensional generalization, so that solvers are implemented almost independently of the number of dimensions.
