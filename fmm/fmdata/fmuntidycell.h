    \brief Header of the FMCell class
    
   A stand-alone, standard C++ class which represents each one of the cells
   of a gridmap and its typical members. Inherited from Cell class, in this
   * case the value_ member represents the distance value (or time of arrival).
   
   IMPORTANT NOTE: no checks are done in the set functions.
