/*! \file solver.hpp
    \brief Templated class which computes the basic Fast Marching Method (FMM).

    It uses as a main container the nDGridMap class. The nDGridMap type T
    has to be an FMCell or something inherited from it.

    The leafsize of the grid map is ignored since it has to be >=1 and that
    depends on the units employed.

    The type of the heap introduced is very important for the behaviour of the
    algorithm. The following heaps are provided:

    - FMDaryHeap wrap for the Boost D_ary heap (generalization of binary heaps).
    * Set by default if no other heap is specified. The arity has been set to 2
    * (binary heap) since it has been tested to be the more efficient in this algorithm.
    - FMFibHeap wrap for the Boost Fibonacci heap.
    - FMPriorityQueue wrap to the std::PriorityQueue class. This heap implies the implementation
    * of the Simplified FMM (SFMM) method, done automatically because of the FMPriorityQueue::increase implementation.
