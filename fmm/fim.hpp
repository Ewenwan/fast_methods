    \brief Templated class which computes the basic Fast Iterative Method.
    
    It uses as a main container the nDGridMap class. The nDGridMap type T
    has to be an FMCell or something inherited from it.
    
    The leafsize of the grid map is ignored since it has to be >=1 and that 
    depends on the units employed.
