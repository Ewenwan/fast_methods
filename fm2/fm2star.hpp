/*! \file fm2star.hpp
    \brief Templated class which computes the Fast Marching Square Star (FM2*).

    This class is the same as FM2 but uses heuristics in the second wave propagation.

    Only FMM is available as underlying planner since using heuristics is not that
    obvious in other planners.

    IMPORTANT NOTE: When running FM2 many times on the same grid it is recommended
    to completely restart the grid (erase and create or resize). See test_fm2.cpp.
