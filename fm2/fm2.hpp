/*! \file fm2.hpp
    \brief Templated class which computes the Fast Marching Square (FM2).

    It uses as a main container the nDGridMap class. The nDGridMap type T
    has to be an FMCell or something inherited from it.

    The leafsize of the grid map is ignored since it has to be >=1 and that
    depends on the units employed.

    The type of the heap are the same as for FMM class.
